<p>The specification gains wireless smartphone integration via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, together with an improved multimedia system. Operated via an eight-inch touchscreen, this benefits from faster software and command response and offers a customisable home screen.

    The Active grade’s features include 17-inch alloy wheels, cruise control air conditioning, smart entry and push-button start, roof rails and heated power door mirrors.
    
    The seven-seat Invincible also adopts the smartphone integration package and is newly available with an optional Black Pack, priced from £57,490.
    
    Customers who opt for black leather upholstery can also specify an all-black exterior, including the front grille, door mirror casings, rear light surrounds, side mouldings and rear garnish, plus clear lenses for the rear light clusters.</p>

<p>Toyota has introduced a new 2.8-litre engine turbodiesel engine to its flagship Land Cruiser SUV and Land Cruiser Commercial range - with prices starting from £35,925.

    The new four-cylinder powerpant, which is set to reach UK showrooms in October as part of an update of the large SUV, delivers a maximum 204PS at 3,000rpm and produces peak torque of 500Nm from 1,600rpm.
    
    This marks an increase of 27bhp and 50Nm on the previous engine and are reflected in a 2.8-second reduction in the 0-62mph time to less than 10 seconds.
    
    The engine meets the UK’s RDE2 (Real Driving Emissions) standard and qualifies for a lower Vehicle Excise Duty charge – down by £325 in the first year compared to the current Land Cruiser.
    
    The Land Cruiser line-up now offers two equipment grades, in a move which Toyota described as being "in-line with customer preferences".
    
    The Active grade is the new entry point to the range, available in three and five-door formats and with five or seven seats, priced from £42,345.</p>
